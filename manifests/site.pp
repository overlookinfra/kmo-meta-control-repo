# This file (./manifests/site.pp) is the main entry point
# used when an agent connects to a master and asks for an updated configuration.
# https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/dirs_manifest.html
#
# Global objects like filebuckets and resource defaults should go in this file,
# as should the default node definition if you want to use it.
